# DualSBAdoption
This tweak simply removes the status bar from the home and lock screen as well as hides the cc grabber to provide a cleaner look on devices that have notches. Compatible with iOS 12. Some credit goes to Cupritix at: https://github.com/Cupritix/StopGrabbingMe/blob/master/Tweak.xm who made a cc grabber hider for iOS 11.
